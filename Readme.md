# Simple Reputation System

## Project Description
The **Simple Reputation System** is a lightweight Clarity smart contract that enables decentralized storage and retrieval of user reputation scores on the Stacks blockchain. It uses a simple key-value mapping from user principal addresses to their reputation scores.

## Project Vision
To create an easy-to-integrate reputation layer that can be plugged into decentralized applications (dApps) for scoring, trust building, and user credibility verification.

## Future Scope
- Add reputation increment/decrement functions with access control.
- Implement penalties or bonuses based on on-chain activity.
- Integrate with decentralized identity solutions for richer profiles.
- Add events/logging for reputation changes.
